* Second list item
+ Third list item
```

- First list item
* Second list items 
+ Third list item

To create an ordered list, start each line with a number followed by a `.` symbol.

```md
1. First list item
2. Second list item
3. Third list item
```

1. First list item
2. Second list item
3. Third list item

You can create a nested list by indenting one or more list items.

```md
1. First list item
   1. Ordered nested list item
2. Second list item
   - Unordered nested list item
```

1. First list item
    1. Ordered nested list item
2. Second list item
    - Unordered nested list item

You can press `Tab` or `Shift+Tab` to indent or unindent one or more selected list items.

### Task lists

To create a task list, start each list item with a hyphen and space followed by `[ ]`.

```md
- [x] This is a completed task.
- [ ] This is an incomplete task.
```

- [x] This is a completed task.
- [ ] This is an incomplete task.

You can toggle a task in Reading view by selecting the checkbox.

>[!tip]
 You can use any character inside the brackets to mark it as complete.

```md
- [x] Milk
- [?] Eggs
- [-] Eggs
- [>] Eggs
```

- [x] Milk
- [?] Eggs
- [-] Eggs
- [>] Eggs

## Horizontal bar

You can use three or more stars `***`, hyphens `---`, or underscore `___` on its own line to add a horizontal bar. You can also separate symbols using spaces.

```md
***
****
* * *
---
----
- - -
___
____
_ _ _
```

## Footnotes

You can add footnotes[^1] to your notes using the following syntax: [^note]

```md
This is a simple footnote[^1].

[^1]: This is the referenced text.
[^2]: Add 2 spaces at the start of each new line.
  This lets you write footnotes that span multiple lines.
[^note]: Named footnotes still appear as numbers, but can make it easier to identify and link references.
```

[^1]: This is a footnote.
[^note]:  This is a named footnote.
  Written over multiple lines.

You can also inline footnotes in a sentence. Note that the caret goes outside the brackets. ^[This is an inline footnote]

```md
You can also use inline footnotes. ^[This is an inline footnote.]
```

> [!note]
 Inline footnotes only work in Reading View, not in Live Preview.

## Comments

You can add comments by wrapping text with `%%`. Comments are only visible in Editing view.

```md
This is an %%inline%% comment.

%%
This is a block comment.

Block comments can span multiple lines.
%%
```

## Tables

You can create table using vertical bars (`|`) and hyphens (`-`). Vertical bars separate columns, and hyphens define the column header.

```md
| First name | Last name |
| ---------- | --------- |
| Max        | Planck    |
| Marie      | Curie     |
```

|First name|Last name|
|---|---|
|Max|Planck|
|Marie|Curie|

The vertical bars or either side of the table are optional.

Cells don't need to be perfectly aligned with the columns. Each header row must have at least two hyphens.

```md
First name | Last name
-- | --
Max | Planck
Marie | Curie
```

### Format content within a table

You can use [basic formatting syntax](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax) to style content within a table.

|First column|Second column|
|---|---|
|[Internal links](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links)|Link to a file _within_ your **vault**.|
|[Embedding files](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Embedding+files)||

Vertical bars in tables

If you want to use [aliases](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Aliases), or to [resize an image](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax#External%20images) in your table, you need to add a `\` before the vertical bar.

```md
| First column | Second column |
| -- | -- |
|[[Markdown Formatting Guide#Basic Formatting Syntax\|Markdown Basics]]|![Engelbart\|75](https://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Basis/images/Engelbart.jpg)|
```

|First column|Second column|
|---|---|
|[[Markdown Formatting Guide#Basic Formatting Syntax\|Markdown Basics]]|![Engelbart\|75](https://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Basis/images/Engelbart.jpg)|

You can align text to the left, right, or center of a column by adding colons (`:`) to the header row.

```md
Left-aligned text | Center-aligned text | Right-aligned text
:-- | :--: | --:
Content | Content | Content
```

|Left-aligned text|Center-aligned text|Right-aligned text|
|:--|:-:|--:|
|Content|Content|Content|

## Diagram

You can add diagrams and charts to your notes, using [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/). Mermaid supports a range of diagrams, such as [flow charts](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html), [sequence diagrams](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/sequenceDiagram.html), and [timelines](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/timeline.html).

>[!tip]
You can also try Mermaid's [Live Editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor) to help you build diagrams before you include them in your notes.

To add a Mermaid diagram, create a `mermaid` [code block](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax#Code%20blocks).

````md
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>+John: Hello John, how are you?
    Alice->>+John: John, can you hear me?
    John-->>-Alice: Hi Alice, I can hear you!
    John-->>-Alice: I feel great!
```
````

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>+John: Hello John, how are you?
    Alice->>+John: John, can you hear me?
    John-->>-Alice: Hi Alice, I can hear you!
    John-->>-Alice: I feel great!
```

````md
```mermaid
graph TD

Biology --> Chemistry
```
````

```mermaid
graph TD

Biology --> Chemistry
```

### Linking files in a diagram

You can create [internal links](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links) in your diagrams by attaching the `internal-link` [class](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html#classes) to your nodes.

````md
```mermaid
graph TD

Biology --> Chemistry

class Biology,Chemistry internal-link;
```
````

```mermaid
graph TD

Biology --> Chemistry

class Biology,Chemistry internal-link;
```

>[!note]
> 
 Internal links from diagrams don't show up in the [Graph view](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Graph+view).
>
 If you have many nodes in your diagrams, you can use the following snippet.
>
> ````md
> ```mermaid
> graph TD
> 
> A[Biology]
>B[Chemistry]
>
 A --> B
>
 class A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z internal-link;
> ```
> ````

```mermaid
graph TD

A[Biology]
B[Chemistry]

A --> B

class A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z internal-link;
```

This way, each letter node becomes an internal link, with the [node text](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html#a-node-with-text) as the link text.

> [!note]
> If you use special characters in your note names, you need to put the note name in double quotes.
> ```
> class "⨳ special character" internal-link
> ```
>
> Or, `A["⨳ special character"]`. 

For more information about creating diagrams, refer to the [official Mermaid docs](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/).

## Math

You can add math expressions to your notes using [MathJax](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/basic/mathjax.html) and the LaTeX notation.

To add a MathJax expression to your note, surround it with double dollar signs (`$$`).

```md
$$
\begin{vmatrix}a & b\\
c & d
\end{vmatrix}=ad-bc
$$
```

$$
\begin{vmatrix}a & b\\
c & d
\end{vmatrix}=ad-bc
$$

You can also inline math expressions by wrapping it in `$` symbols.

```md
This is an inline math expression: $e^{2i\pi} = 1$.
```

This is an inline math expression: $e^{2i\pi} = 1$.

For more information about the syntax, refer to [MathJax basic tutorial and quick reference](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference).

For a list of supported MathJax packages, refer to [The TeX/LaTeX Extension List](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/extensions/index.html).
